<h1>Callback Function</h1>

<p>
    In JavaScript, functions are objects. Can we pass objects to functions as parameters? Yes. <br>
</p>

<p>
    So, we can also pass functions as parameters to other functions and call them inside the outer functions.
</p>

<p>
    JavaScript runs code sequentially in top-down order. However, there are some cases that code runs (or must run) after
    something else happens and also not sequentially. This is called asynchronous programming.  
    Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has
    completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors.  In JavaScript, the way 
    to create a callback function is to pass it as a parameter to another function, and then to call it back right after something 
    has happened or some task is completed.
