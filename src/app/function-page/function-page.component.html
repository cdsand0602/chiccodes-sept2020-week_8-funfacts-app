    <h1>About the Higher Level Function</h1>
</div>

<p>
    Higher order functions can help you to step up your JavaScript game by making your code more declarative. 
    That is, short, simple, and readable.  A Higher Order Function is any function that returns a function when executed, 
    takes a function as one or more of its arguments, or both. If you have used any of the Array methods like map or filter,
    or passed a callback function to jQueryâ€™s $.get, you have already worked with Higher Order Functions. When you use Array.map, 
    you provide a function as its only argument, which it applies to every element contained in the array.
</p>

<p>
    Higher order functions can also return a function. For example, you can make a function called multiplyBy that 
    takes a number and returns a function that multiplies another number you provide by the first number provided.
    You can use this approach to create a multiplyByTwo function to pass to Array.map

    Knowing when and how to use these functions is essential. They make your code easier to understand and maintain.
    It also makes it easy to combine functions with each other. This is called composition.
